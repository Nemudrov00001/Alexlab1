<h1 style="font-size:35px;">Great Pyramid of Giza</h1>
<hr> <p  style="font-size:15.5px;"> <em>"Great Pyramid" redirects here. For the pyramid in Mexico, see <a  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Cholula">Great Pyramid of Cholula.</a></em></p>
<p> <b>The Great Pyramid of Giza </b> (also known as the <b> Pyramid of Khufu </b> or the <b> Pyramid of Cheops</b>) is the oldest and largest of the pyramids in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giza_pyramid_complex">Giza pyramid complex </a> bordering present-day Giza in Greater Cairo, Egypt. It is the oldest of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Wonders_of_the_Ancient_World">Seven Wonders of the Ancient World</a>, and the only one to remain largely intact.</p>

<p style="font-size:15.5px;"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Egyptologists">Egyptologists </a> conclude that the pyramid was built as a tomb for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Dynasty_of_Egypt">Fourth Dynasty</a> Egyptian pharaoh Khufu and estimate that it was built in the 26th century BC during a period of around 27 years. </p>

<p style="font-size:15.5px;"> Initially standing at 146.5 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tallest_buildings_and_structures#History">tallest man-made structure</a> in the world for more than 3,800 years. Throughout history the majority of the smooth white limestone casing was removed, which lowered the pyramid's height to the present 138.5 metres (454.4 ft). What is seen today is the underlying core structure. The base was measured to be about 230.3 metres (755.6 ft) square, giving a volume of roughly 2.6 million cubic metres (92 million cubic feet), which includes an internal hillock. </p>

<p style="font-size:15.5px;"> The dimensions of the pyramid were 280 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubit#Ancient_Egyptian_royal_cubit">royal cubits</a> (146.7 m; 481.4 ft) high, a base length of 440 cubits (230.6 m; 756.4 ft), with a seked of 5 palms (a slope of 51Â°50'40").</p>

<p style="font-size:15.5px;"> The Great Pyramid was built by quarrying an estimated 2.3 million large blocks weighing 6 million tonnes total. The majority of stones are not uniform in size or shape and are only roughly dressed. The outside layers were bound together by mortar. Primarily local limestone from the Giza Plateau was used. Other blocks were imported by boat down the Nile: White limestone from Tura for the casing, and granite blocks from Aswan, weighing up to 80 tonnes, for the King's Chamber structure. </p>

<p style="font-size:15.5px;"> There are three known chambers inside the Great Pyramid. The lowest was cut into the bedrock, upon which the pyramid was built, but remained unfinished. The so-called Queen's Chamber and King's Chamber, that contains a granite sarcophagus, are higher up, within the pyramid structure. Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon), is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. Many varying scientific and alternative hypotheses attempt to explain the exact construction techniques. </p>

<p style="font-size:15.5px;"> The funerary complex around the pyramid consisted of two mortuary temples connected by a causeway (one close to the pyramid and one near the Nile), tombs for the immediate family and court of Khufu, including three smaller pyramids for Khufu's wives, an even smaller "satellite pyramid" and five buried solar barges. </p>

<p> <hr>Historically the Great Pyramid had been attributed to Khufu based on the words of authors of classical antiquity, first and foremost Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus. However, during the middle ages a number of other people were credited with the construction of the pyramid as well, for example Josef, Nimrod or king Saurid.</hr></p>

<h1 style="font-size:20px;">Age <a name="Age"></a></h1>
<p><hr> The Great Pyramid has been determined to be about 4600 years old by two principal approaches: indirectly, through its attribution to Khufu and his chronological age, based on archaeological and textual evidence; and directly, via radiocarbon dating of organic material found in the pyramid and included in its mortar.</hr></p>

<h1 style="font-size:20px;">Historical chronology <a name="Historical chronology"></a></h1>
<p> In the past the Great Pyramid was dated by its attribution to Khufu alone, putting the construction of the Great Pyramid within his reign. Hence dating the pyramid was a matter of dating Khufu and the 4th dynasty. The relative sequence and synchronicity of events stands at the focal point of this method. </p>
<p> Absolute calendar dates are derived from an interlocked network of evidence, the backbone of which are the lines of succession known from ancient king lists and other texts. The reign lengths from Khufu to known points in the earlier past are summated, bolstered with genealogical data, astronomical observations, and other sources. As such, the historical chronology of Egypt is primarily a political chronology, thus independent from other types of archaeological evidence like stratigraphies, material culture, or radiocarbon dating. </p>
<h1 style="font-size:20px;">Radiocarbon dating <a name="Radiocarbon dating"></a></h1>
<p>Mortar was used generously in the Great Pyramid's construction. In the mixing process ashes from fires were added to the mortar, organic material that could be extracted and radiocarbon dated. A total of 46 samples of the mortar were taken in 1984 and 1995, making sure they were clearly inherent to the original structure and could not have been incorporated at a later date. The results were calibrated to 2871-2604 BC. The old wood problem is thought to be mainly responsible for the 100-300 year offset, since the age of the organic material was determined, not when it was last used. A reanalysis of the data gave a completion date for the pyramid between 2620 and 2484 BC, based on the younger samples.</p>
<h1 style="font-size:20px;">History of dating Khufu and the Great Pyramid <a name="History of dating Khufu and the Great Pyramid"></a></h1>
<p> Circa 450 BC Herodotus attributed the Great Pyramid to Cheops (Hellenization of Khufu), yet erroneously placed his reign following the Ramesside period. Manetho, around 200 years later, composed an extensive list of Egyptian kings which he divided into dynasties, assigning Khufu to the 4th. However, after phonetic changes in the Egyptian language and consequently the Greek translation, "Cheops" had transformed into "Souphis" (and similar versions). </p>

<p> The ancient Greek historian Herodotus, writing in the 5th century BC, is one of the first major authors to mention the pyramid. In the second book of his work The Histories, he discusses the history of Egypt and the Great Pyramid. This report was created more than 2000 years after the structure was built, meaning that Herodotus obtained his knowledge mainly from a variety of indirect sources, including officials and priests of low rank, local Egyptians, Greek immigrants, and Herodotus's own interpreters. Accordingly, his explanations present themselves as a mixture of comprehensible descriptions, personal descriptions, erroneous reports, and fantastical legends; as such, many of the speculative errors and confusions about the monument can be traced back to Herodotus and his work.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:20px;">Pliny the Elder <a name="Pliny the Elder"></a></h1>
<p> The Roman writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder">Pliny the Elder</a>, writing in the first century AD, argued that the Great Pyramid had been raised, either "to prevent the lower classes from remaining unoccupied", or as a measure to prevent the pharaoh's riches from falling into the hands of his rivals or successors.[60] Pliny does not speculate as to the pharaoh in question, explicitly noting that "accident [has] consigned to oblivion the names of those who erected such stupendous memorials of their vanity".[61] In pondering how the stones could be transported to such a vast height he gives two explanations: That either vast mounds of nitre and salt were heaped up against the pyramid which were then melted away with water redirected from the river. Or, that "bridges" were constructed, their bricks afterwards distributed for erecting houses of private individuals, arguing that the level of the river is too low for canals to ever bring water up to the pyramid. Pliny also recounts how "in the interior of the largest Pyramid there is a well, eighty-six cubits [45.1 m; 147.8 ft] deep, which communicates with the river, it is thought". Further, he describes a method discovered by Thales of Miletus for ascertaining the pyramid's height by measuring its shadow. </p>

<p>During the<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire"> Roman Empire</a>, Pliny the Elder argues that "bridges" were used to transport stones to the top of the Great Pyramid.</p>

<h1 style="font-size:20px;"><hr>Preparation of the site <a name="Preparation of the site"></a></h1>
<p> A hillock forms the base on which the pyramids stands. It was cut back into steps and only a strip around the perimeter was leveled, which has been measured to be horizontal and flat to within 21 millimetres (0.8 in). The bedrock reaches a height of almost 6 metres (20 ft) above the pyramid base at the location of the Grotto.</p>

<p>Along the sides of the base platform a series of holes are cut in the bedrock. Lehner hypothesizes that they held wooden posts used for alignment.] Edwards, among others, suggested the usage of water for evening the base, although it is unclear how practical and workable such a system would be.</p>
<h1 style="font-size:20px;">Materials <a name="Materials"></a></h1>
<p> The Great Pyramid consists of an estimated 2.3 million blocks. Approximately 5.5 million tonnes of limestone, 8,000 tonnes of granite, and 500,000 tonnes of mortar were used in the construction.</p>

<p>Most of the blocks were quarried at Giza just south of the pyramid, an area now known as the Central Field.</p>

<p>The white limestone used for the casing originated from Tura (10 km (6.2 mi) south of Giza) and was transported by boat down the Nile. In 2013, rolls of papyrus called the Diary of Merer were discovered, written by a supervisor of the deliveries of limestone and other construction materials from Tura to Giza in the last known year of Khufu's reign.</p>

<p>The granite stones in the pyramid were transported from Aswan, more than 900 km (560 mi) away. The largest, weighing 25 to 80 tonnes, form the roofs of the "King's chamber" and the "relieving chambers" above it. Ancient Egyptians cut stone into rough blocks by hammering grooves into natural stone faces, inserting wooden wedges, then soaking these with water. As the water was absorbed, the wedges expanded, breaking off workable chunks. Once the blocks were cut, they were carried by boat either up or down the Nile River to the pyramid. </p> <br>
